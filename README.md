# sound_analyzer
A simple Flutter application that measures the current amplitude of the microphone in dB and can save recordings as .wav files

## Sound Anaylyzer
There is only one file of code in this demo project - lib/main.dart

I used two different libraries
 * flutter_sound to measure the amplitude in dB
 * recorder_wav to save a wav file

Note: There is a possibility that we could get the raw amplitude of the microphone

## Building the Project
1. Download and install flutter by following the online instructions
2. Clone this repo
2. Open terminal and type ```flutter doctor``` to make sure everything is set up correctly.
2. Connect a device to your computer (or run an emulator)
2. Type ```flutter run``` in terminal to build and run the project on your device
2. Feel free to mess around with the code and press ```r``` in the terminal to hot reload
